TTT Support
- More support on Popular Gun Bases

What is some ideas that you might want to do in the future?

- Crosshairs From CA
- ARC-9 Combat Arms connection to the HUD (Maybe like the Heartbeat Sensor)
- BroadCast System of what the Accolade the player is on to everybody on the server
- Hurt screen overlay and where the hurt is coming from
- A Font System that fits in with the Hud so the weapon name can be printed on the screen
- GUI in the Q Menu so console commands is not the only way to set up the HUD
- Messaging System Like in Combat Arms
- Kill Feed System Like in Combat Arms
